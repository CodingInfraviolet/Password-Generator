The database will be used to store restrictions on different websites.
Let's say google.com requires a minimum length of 6, while facebook doesn't allow
the _ character (for example :P). The page will take these limitations into account
and store them in the database per user so that they will be applied next time
they generate a password without having to be explicitly specified.

Table:
    Cumulative Password Hash (unique per user. User ID :3)
    Website name (trimmed, lowercase, hashed)
    Min Length (null=none)
    Max length (null=none)
    Forbidden characters (null=none)
    Avoid dictionary attacks (null=no)
    When the password was added
